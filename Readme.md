Due to how Java works I haven't found a way to have focus without the use of a JFrame. Therefore there is one extra frame in the game which acts as a controller for key-bindings etc. I tried to make this more obvious in the code but then the loading of the game got fucked up so I aborted that.

Controls are arrows for directions with applied gravity (that means down doesn't do anything). Also teleportation is instant and not Portal-like, because I felt like it, that's why.

The point with this game was to have a game with a gamemap who was detached for some time of the game and since that is done I really have no more I want to get out of this, but I might add some weapons and nicer outfit for a player as well as functionality for more players. However I do not make any promises, since I do not want anything to be hold against me if I do not want to spend more time on this project.

If you have read this far, feel free to poke me with comments or tips. If not, go do something stupid.

Cheers!
